        It all started with a simple passion: the love for real burgers. Back in
        [write the year], we wanted to break the routine and create something
        different for food lovers — not just another burger, but a full
        experience filled with flavor, quality, and the warm feeling of home.

      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 capitalize text-[#ff4f00]">our history</h1>
      <p className="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed text-justify max-w-3xl mx-auto text-white">
        From the very first day we opened our doors, our mission has been to
        serve every burger with care, using only 100% fresh ingredients and
        authentic recipes. Step by step, we grew — and so did our family of
        customers who shared their best moments around our tables. Today, we are
        more than just a restaurant. We are a place where people come together
        to laugh, connect, and enjoy a burger made with love.
